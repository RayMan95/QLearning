VS Solution changes:
  1)To get my solution to build, I had to change my Windows SDK version to 10.0.15063.0 (from 8.1) and my Platform Toolset to Visual Studio 2017 (v141) (from VS 2013) 
    * to change back: right click 'smart sweepers' project in Solution Explorer > Properties > Configuration Properties > General
